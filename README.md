### Brief
A C++ metaprogramming experiment... What if there was a pretty print function for `std::vector`?

### Usage
 - Get CMake and Git if not available.
 - Clone this repository by its cloning URL.
 - Run `cmake .`
 - Build the demo code with `make all` or your native build system's "all" target.
 - Run `./bin/testprint`.
